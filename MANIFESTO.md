# SOVEREIGN – A Manifesto for Digital Self‑Determination
> Published — 02 Oct 2025

### Preamble

_"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves."_<sup>[1]</sup>

We live in an era where a handful of corporations wield unprecedented power over the flow of information, the shape of our workplaces, and the very infrastructure of our daily lives. Their business models profit from the extraction, commodification, profiling, and surveillance of our data, turning the internet into a private utility that serves shareholders rather than citizens.

The economy of the digital age has become one where every interaction, every search, every message is quietly transformed into data; mined, analysed, and sold. Some call this stage of capitalism as _technofeudalism_<sup>[2]</sup>: a system where Big Tech controls the digital land we inhabit, demanding rent in the form of our privacy, attention, and autonomy. With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, this imbalance of power deepens further, monopolies are consolidating and human agency is eroding.

### The Crisis of Dependence

We are told we are "users", but what we really are is products. Our connections, our communities, and our creativity are enclosed within walled gardens. Interoperability is deliberately broken. Terms of service dictate our freedoms. To dissent is to be disconnected.

The consequence is a creeping loss of sovereignty: the slow decay of our ability to govern our digital lives, make informed choices, and build technologies that serve human needs rather than corporate interests.

This is not merely a technical problem. It is political, economic, and cultural. To accept the dominance of Big Tech is to accept a world where innovation is suppressed, freedom is conditional, and dignity is negotiable.

### The Limits of Resistance

And yet, those who critique Big Tech too often fall short of offering real alternatives. We see brilliant technologies, powerful tools, and vibrant communities working to create another path, but too rarely do these efforts meet people where they are.

User experience, accessibility, and design are treated as afterthoughts, leaving everyday people locked out of the very tools that claim to liberate them. The result is a vast gulf between the polished convenience of corporate platforms and the rough edges of their alternatives. Unless we close this gap, resistance risks becoming symbolic rather than transformative.

It is not enough to critique or to code; we must **build with care**, **design with empathy**, and **deliver with usability**. Only then will digital sovereignty become more than an idea for the few; it will become a lived reality for the many.

### Our Call

We refuse this. We assert the right to **digital self-determination**.

- To own the infrastructure we depend on.
- To use technology without surrendering our privacy.
- To collaborate without exploitation.
- To learn, to share, and to create on open terms.

Self-determination means building tools that empower communities rather than extract from them. It means rejecting dependency on systems designed to keep us captive. It means reclaiming the internet as a commons; a space of participation, not enclosure.

### Principles of Sovereignty

1.	**Autonomy over dependence** — Tools must serve people, not the other way around.
2.	**Openness over enclosure** — Knowledge and code must remain accessible, forkable, and free to evolve.
3.	**Privacy over surveillance** — What we create, share, or store must not be weaponized against us.
4.	**Community over monopoly** — Technology should strengthen collaboration, not consolidate control.
5.	**Resilience over fragility** — Decentralization, interoperability, and redundancy must replace brittle centralization.
6.	**Usability over obscurity** — Alternatives must be accessible, intuitive, and dignified for all people, not just the technically skilled.

### Toward a New Digital Commons

SOVEREIGN is not a product. It is not a brand. It is a commitment to reclaim our future.

We call on technologists, activists, communities, and citizens to refuse resignation. To experiment, to federate, to build true alternatives. To create a digital ecosystem grounded not in extraction but in dignity.

The internet was once imagined as a space of liberation. It can be again.

This is our manifesto. This is our stand.
